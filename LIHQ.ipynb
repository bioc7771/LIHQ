It works best with clean audio, no background noise, and **a similar tone throughout each file**. If your voice does not come out good, try again with the highest preset and longer sentences.

Cartoony voices, fast or high pitched voices, or accents outside of America are the most difficult to work with, and sometimes I just couldn't get a voice to work. When it does work, it works really well though. All voices in the demo video were made using TortToiSe except the male UK voice (VITS) and Rick's catchphrase (ripped from youtube)."
